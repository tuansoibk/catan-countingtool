# Catan Counting Tool
This counting tool help to reveal the number of resource cards that all players have in their hand, including bank cards while you are playing Catan at [Colonist.io](https://colonist.io). It is extremely useful when 'Private Bank Card' is set and you have a Monopoly card in your hand :smiling_imp:.

## Usage
* Install the extension in Chrome
* Go to a game with other players
* Open the extension at any time and click 'Reload', the extension will show all players' cards in it popup window
* Click 'Reload' again to fetch for latest update (the extension does not poll for resource changes)
* If you go for another game, click 'Init' to reset all the countings

## Limitation
* At the moment, it only works with games of 4 players
* It only works if you aren't disconnected from the game for any moment (see 'How it works')
* It will not work in spectating mode

## How it works
* The tool read a list of game logs from the web page while you're playing and do the counting base on that. Therefore, it is impossible to do the correct counting if any log is missing (when you are disconnected).
